# Weather API App

A frontend weather app, calling the OpenWeather API.

It accepts different cities or countries and returns the weather data presented in a readable card format.

Used async/await to fetch data and promises to process that data. Built with JS, HTML and CSS.

Used Webpack to bundle and compile the JS scripts into a main.js file.

Created a toggle button that switches temperature data from Celsius to Fahrenheit, and vice versa.

## FEATURES:
- get weather for any city
- switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius
- get local sunrise/sunset times
